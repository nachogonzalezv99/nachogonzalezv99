### Hi, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a web application developer specialized in Front-end. I also have extensive knowledge in back-end development with the MERN stack and in blockchain development with Solidity.

Since I was twelve years old I have been fascinated by how the technology worked. I started with video game development and then ended up designing and programming web applications. Since then I have combined self-taught learning with different academic training.
